Arda is a social network where users can share posts on different topics, make comments, and follow each other, among other functionalities. The user interface was inspired by X/Twitter and Reddit.
The technologies I used were Spring Boot for the backend with dependencies like Spring Security, Spring Data REST, and Spring Data JPA. 
Authentication is handled with JSON Web Tokens, and the data is stored in a MariaDB relational database. On the frontend, I use React with TypeScript.
